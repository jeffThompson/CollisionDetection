#CHALLENGES  
Try these challenge prompts to modify the code we've written. Don't get frustrated if you can't figure them all out &mdash; some are intended for more practiced programmers:

1. Try changing the colors of the objects when they collide. Hint: look in the `draw()` section.  
2. Can you make something else interesting happen when collision occurs? Objects change size, move across the screen, etc?  
3. Our [Point/Point](point-point.php) collision is very finicky: you have to be in the *exact* location of the other point for the collision to trigger. Can you modify the code to include a "buffer zone" where collision happens, even if the two points aren't actually touching?
