#CHALLENGES  
Try these challenge prompts to modify the code we've written:

1. Can you add to our algorithm to highlight the polygon edge that is hit?  
2. Can you make polygons whose vertices change position over time? Hint: you can use `random()`, but for more natural motion, look at the [Perlin noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) example in `Basics > Math > Noise2D` in the Processing IDE.  
3. Randomized polygons make great abstract monsters! Can you build a simple game with randomized polygons chasing each other?
