#CHALLENGES  
Try these challenge prompts to modify the code we've written:

1. Can you make an object change color gradually as the mouse gets closer? Hint: use `map()` to convert the distance to a useful range. You can also use `lerpColor()` to create smooth color transitions.
2. As noted, these examples assume the default `rectMode(CENTER)`. Can you make new versions to work with `rectMode(CENTER)` instead?
2. With [Circle/Rectangle](circle-rectangle.php) collision covered, we have enough to build [Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)! Can you create a simple version with rectangles as paddles and a circle as the ball?
