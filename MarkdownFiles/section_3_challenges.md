#CHALLENGES  
Try these challenge prompts to modify the code we've written:

1. [Lasers!](https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+lasers&sa=X&biw=970&bih=818&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ei=A5hXVb7mCcWwsAT0rYGoCA&ved=0CB4QsAQ) Can you build a simple game where the players uses the mouse to navigate an array of lasers and get to the other side of a room? Draw your character as a simple circle or rectangle, or replace them with an image but test the collision as a bounding circle or box.  
2. Using [Line/Circle](line-circle.php) collision, we can simulate a ball bouncing off an angled surface. Can you add gravity, plus make the circle bounce off in a direction based on the angle of the line? Hint: to get the bounce direction, get the angle between the ball and the closest point on the line. For this, you can use Processing's `angleBetween()` function.
